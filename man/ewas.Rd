\description{
Test associations between \code{variable} and each row of \code{beta}
while adjusting for \code{covariates} (fixed effects) and \code{batch} (random effect).
NB only handles discrete 2 catagory variables
If \code{cell.counts} is not \code{NULL}, then it is assumed that
the methylation data is derived from samples with two cell types.
\code{cell.counts} should then be a vector of numbers
between 0 and 1 of length equal to \code{variable} corresponding
to the proportions of cell of a selected cell type in each sample.
The regression model is then modified in order to identify
associations specifically in the selected cell type (PMID: 24000956).
