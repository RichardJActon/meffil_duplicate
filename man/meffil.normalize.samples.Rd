\usage{
meffil.normalize.samples(norm.objects, pseudo = 100, just.beta = T,
  cpglist.remove = NULL, max.bytes = 2^30 - 1, gds.filename = NULL,
  verbose = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{norm.objects}{The list or sublist of \code{\link{meffil.normalize.quantiles}()}.}

\item{pseudo}{Value to add to the denominator to make the methylation
estimate more stable when calculating methylation levels (Default: 100).}

\item{just.beta}{If \code{TRUE}, then return just the normalized methylation levels; otherwise,
return the normalized methylated and unmethylated matrices (Default: TRUE).}

\item{cpglist.remove}{Optional list of CpGs to exclude from final output}

\item{gds.filename}{If not \code{NULL} (default), then saves the output to a GDS (Genomic Data Structure).
This is for cases where the output is too large to fit into main memory.
The GDS option assumes that argument \code{just.beta == TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, then detailed status messages are printed during execution (Default: \code{FALSE}).}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[parallel]{mclapply}()}.}
}
\value{
If \code{just.beta == TRUE}, the normalized matrix of 
methylation levels between between 0 and 1
equal to methylated signal/(methylated + unmethylated signal + pseudo).
Otherwise, a list containing two matrices, the normalized methylated and unmethylated signals.
If \code{gds.filename} is not \code{NULL}, then the output is saved to the GDS file
rather than retained in memory and returned to the caller.
The library 'gdsfmt' must be installed.

Normalize a set of samples using their normalized quality control objects.
