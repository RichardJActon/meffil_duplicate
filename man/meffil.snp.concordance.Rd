\title{Concordance between genotypes and SNP betas}
\usage{
meffil.snp.concordance(snp.betas, genotypes, snp.threshold = 0.99,
  sample.threshold = 0.9)
}
\value{
Returns a list of two vectors:
    - one providing concordances between genotypes and SNP betas for matched samples,
    - a second providing concordances between genotypes and SNP betas for matched SNPs.
as well as the genotype matrix derived from 'snp.betas'.
